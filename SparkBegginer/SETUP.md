# Project Setup Guide

## 1. Creating a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment (venv) is crucial for Python projects to isolate dependencies. It ensures that your project uses specific versions of libraries without conflicts from other projects. This isolation helps maintain a clean and controlled development environment.

### Steps:
1. **Create the Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
2. **Activate the Envirenment**
    macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
    Windows:
        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
