#Learning PySpark with humor
When I am documenting things I use a bit of humor because otherwise it is not fun!!!
# Project Documentation
I will be documenting issues that i faced in every step and how i resolved them so if anyone else look at this repo hopefully they would not spend some time banging their head ;)

# Next Step
now we are ready to download our data set. Here we use the data from Chicago Data Portal. The dataset is the [Crimes - 2001 to Present](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/jzptg8t2/about_data). The dataset has 8135603 rows at the time of this project. Hopefuly does not grow fast 
In this page you would nedd to click on Export on the top right corner and from the dialog the CSV as the export format and make sure the all data is the selected option. Right now it is the only option :D
